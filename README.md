## ‚û°Ô∏è CurrencyExchange

### üî∏ GET `/exchange?from=BASE_CURRENCY_CODE&to=TARGET_CURRENCY_CODE&amount=$AMOUNT`

> Calculation of the transfer of a certain amount of funds from one currency to another. An example of a request is GET `/exchange?from=ETB&to=RUB&amount=10`.
  
- Obtaining an exchange rate can take place according to one of three scenarios: `direct exchange`, `reverse exchange`, `exchange through an intermediary`.

```json

    "base_currency": {
        "id": 9,
        "name": "Ethiopian Birr",
        "code": "ETB",

}
```

## ‚û°Ô∏è Exceptions
- For all requests, in case of an error, the response may look like this: 

```json
{
    "message": "Currency pair not found :("
}
```

- The value of the `message` depends on what kind of error occurred.
- Errors that are possible: `DataBaseNotAvailableException`, `IncorrectParamsException`, `ObjectAlreadyExistException`, `ObjectNotFoundException`
